    {
        "question": "Differentiate between 'product orientation' and 'process orientation' in evaluating performance.",

    {
        "question": "How do cognitive distortions contribute to feelings of hopelessness?",
        "answer": "Cognitive distortions such as emotional reasoning (feeling hopeless, therefore being hopeless), fortune-telling (predicting negative outcomes as facts), all-or-nothing thinking (only completely happy or completely depressed), overgeneralization, mental filter, discounting the positive, 'should' statements, magnification, and personalization can all lead to feelings of hopelessness."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the therapist's role in helping patients overcome hopelessness?",
        "answer": "One of the most important tasks of any therapist is to help depressed patients find the courage and determination to resist and fight these hopeless feelings, even when the patients are convinced these feelings are valid."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the general philosophy regarding the use of antidepressants in treatment?",
        "answer": "Antidepressants should have a profound and dramatic effect to justify their continued use. Every patient taking antidepressants should regularly take a mood test to reliably measure the drug's effectiveness. If improvement is minimal, switching to another medication, a combination of medication and psychotherapy, or psychotherapy alone is recommended."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is the recommended approach for combining medication and psychotherapy for depression?",
        "answer": "It is generally recommended to combine antidepressant medication treatment with psychotherapy. The drugs-only approach is often not satisfactory, and the combination tends to produce better short-term and long-term results."

    },
    {
        "question": "Is depression always caused by a 'chemical imbalance' in the brain?",
        "answer": "The belief that depression results from a chemical or hormonal imbalance in the brain is an unproven theory, not a fact. Scientists still do not know the exact cause of depression or how antidepressants work, and there is no test to demonstrate a chemical imbalance."
    },
    {
        "question": "When might an antidepressant be recommended if a patient initially prefers drug-free therapy?",
        "answer": "If a patient prefers drug-free therapy but shows no improvement after six to ten weeks of hard work in cognitive therapy, an antidepressant might be suggested to 'put some high octane in the tank' and potentially accelerate recovery or make psychotherapy more effective."
