    },
    {
        "question": "Differentiate between 'product orientation' and 'process orientation' in evaluating performance.",
        "answer": "A 'product orientation' evaluates performance exclusively on the outcome, leading to emotional instability. In contrast, a 'process orientation' allows one to pride themselves on consistent effort and input regardless of the immediate outcome, promoting self-esteem."
    },
    {
        "question": "What is 'Fear of Success' as a barrier to personal growth?",
        "answer": "Fear of Success stems from a lack of confidence, where success seems risky because it's believed to be based on chance and unsustainable. This leads to concerns that accomplishments will falsely raise expectations, and subsequent failure will bring greater disappointment."

        "answer": "A great deal of anger involves a defense against the loss of self-esteem when people criticize or disagree, and such anger is considered inappropriate because only one's own negative distorted thoughts can cause a loss of self-esteem."
